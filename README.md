# Tech-Task

1) Create a GitHub project to share with me
2) Develop a simple Java Restful controller which exposes one endpoint
3) The endpoint allows me to request a Person object
4) Although it is simple application, I would expect to see proper coding techniques
 
* Don't worry about database or over engineering. Simply return the same Person object each time
